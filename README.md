## Extraction of Text from PDF

First install pdftotext following the instructions [here](https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext). Remember to install poppler (use the following command if using Homebrew on Mac)

```  
brew install pkg-config poppler python
```

Run `python3 pdfToText.py` after cd-ing into the extraction directory to examine text conversion.
